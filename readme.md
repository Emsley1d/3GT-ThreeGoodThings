# 3GT - Three Good Things

## Description:

The	Three Good Things exercise is intended to increase happiness and a sense of	
wellbeing. An individual records 3 good things they've done on any given day; with the intention of redirecting attention and energy away from negative and towards positive thoughts. Studies have shown that people who wrote down and shared what they were grateful for each day, for just one week, ended up being happier up to six months later.

Mental health is one of the things I am passionate about and the Three Good Things exercise is something that has proved helpful to me in the past. 

# Planning:

## Initial Thoughts: 

- To allow users to sign up using different methods, email, Google etc.
- To provide email confirmation of sign up and option to reset password by email.
- Fully responsive for both desktop and mobile. 
- Weekly and monthly calendar views of completed days; each day could be coloured differently. A completed day with 3 things logged could be green; a day with 0 things logged could be red.
- Social Media functionality; ability to have a 'feed' of other users; ability to follow other users and 'like' or support their posts in some way.
- Privacy button; so a users certain days/activities can be removed from their public feed. Or their profile can be made completely private. 
- Provide user's with alerts if they haven't done something for a while; i.e. not logged that they've been to the gym for a week.
- Table of a user's most popular things with drag/drop functionality so a user doesn't have to write the same things each day; they can just drag an item from their list and drop it onto a day to add it.
- Option to flip between light and dark modes.

## Project Aims:

- To incorporate as many of my initial thoughts as possible.
- To have full authentication and authoristation.
- Connect the email functionality with a server host.
